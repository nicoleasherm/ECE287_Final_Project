Nicole Sherman and Emma Ostrowski: 

We worked on the entire project together. Our schedules aligned so we were able to work on the project together meeting outside of scheduled lab time. Our ideas came together to produce the final project. We worked through every error together to find a solution. Nicole typed the work while Emma researched code but we collaborated nicely and were able to explain parts of the code to each other that the other found confusing or troubling.
